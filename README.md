wef-bootstrap
=============

Integrates IBM Web Experience Factory with Bootstrap 

This project contains a WEF Theme that shows how to integrate WEF with Bootstrap. This includes the theme file, data definition, html template, DSUI base pages, and a sample model. 
The theme gives you basic DSUI functionality for list, details, and edits pages.

Currently the Bootstrap css and jQuery are pulled in from a CDN.

Future work needed:

* Bootstrap enable Builder
* Bootstrap Paging UI
* Input Controls (e.g. Date picker)
* Navigation Builder

### Installation

Download the [wef_bootstrap.zip](/output/wef_bootstrap.zip) or build it from source. To build from source you will need to run 'ant' from the project folder.

Once you have the wef_bootstrap.zip file use the Import > Web Experience Factory Archive to add to an existing project.
